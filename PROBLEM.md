## Problem Statement: Super class method computes the product of two integers and Subclass overrides the method to compute the power of two integers 

**This exercise should be completed using Test Driven Development Technique**

- Test classes provided in this exercise will show compilation errors, when the exercise is cloned locally
- Classes and methods should be created by analysing the test code, so that there are no compilation errors
- Functionality of methods should be completed, such that all the test cases pass
- Some of the requirements/hints are mentioned below

- In this problem, Super class method computes the product of two integers and Subclass overrides the method to compute the power of two integers

      - Should return product result when super type method is called using lambda expression created using method reference
      - Should return power result when sub type method is called using lambda expression created using method reference
      
**Note: use lambda expression, BiFunction functional interface, Method reference using super keyword**  
   
## Instructions
- Avoid printing unnecessary values other than expected output as given in sample
- Take care of whitespace/trailing whitespace
- Do not change the provided class/method names unless instructed
- Follow best practices while coding
